# na--'s ebook-tools: a Python port of the shell scripts
# ref.: https://bit.ly/2qYZeqF

# IMPORTANT: The script convert-to-txt.py don't have any local option, but some
# of the global options affect this script's behavior a lot, especially the OCR
# ones, see https://bit.ly/2HoCxHl


[general-options]
# All of these options are part of the common library and may affect some or
# all of the scripts.

#########################
# General control flags #
#########################

# Whether debug messages will be displayed on stderr. Passing the parameter or
# changing VERBOSE to true and piping the stderr to a file is useful for
# debugging or keeping a record of exactly what happens without cluttering and
# overwhelming the normal execution output.
verbose=False

# If this is enabled, no file rename/move/symlink/etc. operations will actually
# be executed.
dry_run=False

# Instead of moving the ebook files, create symbolic links to them.
symlink_only=False

# Do not delete the gathered metadata for the organized ebooks, instead save it
# in an accompanying file together with each renamed book. It is very useful for
# semi-automatic verification of the organized files with interactive-organizer.py
# or for additional verification, indexing or processing at a later date.
keep_metadata=False

# Options related to extracting ISBNs from files and finding metadata by ISBN #
###############################################################################

# This is the regular expression used to match ISBN-like numbers in the supplied
# books. It is matched with python `re` module, so look-ahead and look-behind
# can be used. Also it is purposefully a bit loose (i.e. it can match some
# non-ISBN numbers), since the found numbers will be checked for validity.
ISBN_REGEX=(?<![0-9])(-?9-?7[789]-?)?((-?[0-9]-?){9}[0-9xX])(?![0-9])

# This is a regular expression that is matched against the MIME type of the
# searched files. Matching files are searched directly for ISBNs, without
# converting or OCR-ing them to .txt first.
ISBN_DIRECT_GREP_FILES=^(text/(plain|xml|html)|application/xml)$

# This is a regular expression that is matched against the MIME type of the
# searched files. Matching files are not searched for ISBNs beyond their
# filename. The default value is a bit long because it tries to make the scripts
# ignore .gif and .svg images, audio, video and executable files and fonts.
ISBN_IGNORED_FILES=^(image/(gif|svg.+)|application/(x-shockwave-flash|CDFV2|vnd.ms-opentype|x-font-ttf|x-dosexec|vnd.ms-excel|x-java-applet)|audio/.+|video/.+)$

# These options specify if and how we should reorder the ebook text before
# searching for ISBNs in it. By default, the first 400 lines of the text are
# searched as they are, then the last 50 are searched in reverse and finally
# the remainder in the middle. This reordering is done to improve the odds that
# the first found ISBNs in a book text actually belong to that book (ex. from
# the copyright section or the back cover), instead of being random ISBNs
# mentioned in the middle of the book. No part of the text is searched twice,
# even if these regions overlap. If you use the command-line option, the format
# for <value> is false to disable the functionality or first_lines,last_lines
# to enable it with the specified values.
ISBN_GREP_REORDER_FILES=True
ISBN_GREP_RF_SCAN_FIRST=400
ISBN_GREP_RF_REVERSE_LAST=50

# This option allows you to specify the online metadata sources and order in
# which the scripts will try searching in them for books by their ISBN. The
# actual search is done by calibre's `fetch-ebook-metadata` command-line
# application, so any custom calibre metadata plugins [1] can also be used.
# To see the currently available options, run `fetch-ebook-metadata --help` and
# check the description for the `--allowed-plugin` option.

# Options for OCR #
###################

# Whether to enable OCR for .pdf, .djvu and image files. It is disabled by
# default and can be used differently in two scripts:
# - organize-ebooks.py can use OCR for finding ISBNs in scanned books. Setting
#   the value to true will cause it to use OCR for books that failed to be
#   converted to .txt or were converted to empty files by the simple conversion
#   tools (ebook-convert, pdftotext, djvutxt). Setting the value to always will
#   cause it to use OCR even when the simple tools produced a non-empty result,
#   if there were no ISBNs in it.
# - convert-to-txt.py can use OCR for the conversion to .txt. Setting the value
#   to true will cause it to use OCR for books that failed to be converted to
#   .txt or were converted to empty files by the simple conversion tools.
#   Setting it to always will cause it to first try OCR-ing the books before
#   trying the simple conversion tools.
OCR_ENABLED=False

# Value n,m instructs the scripts to convert only the first n and last m pages
# when OCR-ing ebooks. This is done because OCR is a slow resource-intensive
# process and ISBN numbers are usually at the beginning or at the end of books.
#  Setting the value to false disables this optimization and is the default for
# convert-to-txt.py, where we probably want the whole book to be converted.
OCR_ONLY_FIRST_LAST_PAGES=7,3

# This allows us to define a hook for using custom OCR settings or software.
# The default value is just a wrapper that allows us to use both tesseract 3
# and 4 with some predefined settings. You can use a custom bash function or
# shell script - the first argument is the input image (books are OCR-ed page
# by page) and the second argument is the file you have to write the output
# text to.
# TODO: test if you can give a bash function or shell script, right now
# it is a python function
OCR_COMMAND=tesseract_wrapper

# Options related to extracting and searching for non-ISBN metadata #
#####################################################################

# When files and file metadata are parsed, they are split into words (or more
# precisely, either alpha or numeric tokens) and ones shorter than this value
# are ignored. By default, single and two character number and words are ignored.
TOKEN_MIN_LENGTH=3

# TODO: RE_YEAR not defined
# A regular expression that is matched against the filename/author/title tokens
# and matching tokens are ignored. The default regular expression includes
# common words that probably hinder online metadata searching like book, novel,
# series, volume and others, as well as probable publication years like (so
# 1999 is ignored while 2033 is not). You can see it in lib.py.
TOKENS_TO_IGNORE=ebook|book|novel|series|ed(ition)?|vol(ume)?|${RE_YEAR}

# This option allows you to specify the online metadata sources in which the
# scripts will try searching for books by non-ISBN metadata (i.e. author and
# title). The actual search is done by calibre's `fetch-ebook-metadata`
# command-line application, so any custom calibre metadata plugins [1] can also
# be used. To see the currently available options, run `fetch-ebook-metadata --help`
# and check the description for the `--allowed-plugin` option.
# In contrast to searching by ISBNs, searching by author and title is done
# concurrently in all of the allowed online metadata sources. The number of
# sources is smaller because some metadata sources can be searched only by ISBN
# or return many false-positives when searching by title and author.

#################################################
# Options related to the input and output files #
#################################################

# This specifies how the filenames of the organized files will look. It is a
# bash string that is evaluated so it can be very flexible [1] (and also
# potentially unsafe). The book metadata is present in a hashmap with name `d`
# and uppercase keys. When changing this parameter, keep in mind that you have
# to either escape the `$` symbols or wrap everything in single quotes like so:
#      OUTPUT_FILENAME_TEMPLATE='"${d[TITLE]} by ${d[AUTHORS]}.${d[EXT]}"'
# [1] http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/parameter-substitution.html
#
# By default the organized files start with the comma-separated author name(s),
# followed by the book series name and number in square brackets (if present),
# followed by the book title, the year of publication (if present), the ISBN(s)
# (if present) and the original extension. Here are are how output filenames
# using the default template look:
# Cory Doctorow - [Little Brother #1] - Little Brother (2008) [0765319853].pdf
# Eliezer Yudkowsky - Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (2015).epub
